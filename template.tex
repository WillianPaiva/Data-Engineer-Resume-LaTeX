        {
          {\begin{itemize}
            \item My responsibilities at \textit{Lucine} are: team and project management
              using agile (SCRUM) methodology and do the R\&D of the core AI
              system of the company, where I work mainly with \textit{Tensorflow},
              creating models for facial recognition of pain by using
              architectures that relies on convolutional and recurrent networks.
              Among my responsibilities are also tasks such as manage the
              company's resources on \textit{google cloud}, \textit{Vsphere} (HDS) server and some
              \textit{DevOps}.

          {\begin{itemize}

            \item As a first experience, I did an internship in a start-up called \textit{1Flow}. I had to elaborate and develop a protocol for RSS flow and to create a full text parsing site of information ; I had to benchmark the different existing methods, and make choices, then develop the application and implement it for tests. I used \textit{Jenkins} setup and different ways of coding such as the \textit{Django framework} and \textit{MongoDB}.\\
