after a 8 years experience on a industrial environment at a petrol company in Brazil, where i acquired my training's in machining.
i decided it was time for a change and took 2 years a intensive English course in Ireland.
after my wedding i moved to Bordeaux France, where i was presented with a chance to shift my area of work.
and enrolled my self on a professional programming training, and as i liked what i was doing and the hunger for more knowledge on the area.
i decided that just a professional training wasn't enough and enrolled my self at the Bordeaux university with the aim of a masters degree.
